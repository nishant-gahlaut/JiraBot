The sheet for case2 contains users who already have points from the target completion events. I have mentioned already allocated points for users of org 9000209 in same sheet.Please let me know what to do for these users as these users fall in case1.

Harish Kumar: Original Author: Sourabh Tiwari Posted on: 2/24/2025, 11:13:29 AM Hi @Prateek Yadav ,In the cleanup sheet for case 2, usertarget id of corresponding cycle is also mentioned. Hence, I tried only the usertarget ids which are mentioned. If there are other cycles of users which needs to be checked then they will have different usertarget ids. can you get the correct usertarget ids added in the sheet? Harish Kumar: Original Author: Prateek Yadav Posted on: 2/24/2025, 8:21:25 PM @Nitish Reddy - can you confirm if the document has the updated data with correct usertargetid in place? Harish Kumar: Original Author: Nitish Reddy Posted on: 2/24/2025, 8:37:55 PM @Prateek Yadav yes, but I can re-run and validate if any new user targets were added since Sunday.

Thank you for the update. For the 5 users whose target completed event falls prior to promotion enrollment: can we unenroll, re-enroll, fire BEs to give them their reward. We normally would not do this but they also have genuine events that were received post promotion issual that would have achieved their target properly post issual if not for our config issue in Jan that counted pre issual events. Harish Kumar: Original Author: Sourabh Tiwari Posted on: 3/21/2025, 5:35:45 PM Hi @Nitish Reddy ,can I update promotion issual date to 1st jan for these users and replay targetCompleted events. It will be quicker and less error prone? Harish Kumar: Original Author: Nitish Reddy Posted on: 3/21/2025, 6:50:36 PM Can we revert the issual date back again after the firing? Reporting may be impacted if we change the issual date @Sourabh Tiwari Harish Kumar: Original Author: Sourabh Tiwari Posted on: 3/24/2025, 1:06:55 PM yeah, I have done the cleanup in mentioned way and reverted the issual date back to original. Points are awarded to remaining 5 customers of benco.Now, lumen org is remaining where choice reward was not present in payload. Harish Kumar: Original Author: Sourabh Tiwari Posted on: 3/25/2025, 6:55:04 PM Hi Nitish,For lumen 9000209, points are awarded to eligible customers after updating choice reward and promotion issualdate.For global atlantic, points are awarded to one customer after updating choice reward and promotion issualdate.Other details are mentioned in the sheet, where points are not awarded. Most of them have hit capping limit.Everything seems to be done on this ticket, closing it now. Please let us know if anything else remains.cc: @Akhilesh Baldi @Pawan Verma\n"

harish kumar: original author: nitish reddy posted on: 3/21/2025, 6:50:36 pm can we revert the issual date back again after the firing? reporting may be impacted if we change the issual date @sourabh tiwari harish kumar: original author: sourabh tiwari posted on: 3/24/2025, 1:06:55 pm yeah, i have done the cleanup in mentioned way and reverted the issual date back to original. points are awarded to remaining 5 customers of benco.now, lumen org is remaining where choice reward was not present in payload. harish kumar: original author: sourabh tiwari posted on: 3/25/2025, 6:55:04 pm hi nitish,for lumen 9000209, points are awarded to eligible customers after updating choice reward and promotion issualdate.for global atlantic, points are awarded to one customer after updating choice reward and promotion issualdate.other details are mentioned in the sheet, where points are not awarded. most of them have hit capping limit.everything seems to be done on this ticket, closing it now. please let us know if anything else remains.cc: @akhilesh baldi @pawan verma\n"
