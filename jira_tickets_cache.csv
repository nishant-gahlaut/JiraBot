CP-12245,Optum - Promotion rule not evaluating correctly,"We have a case where a promotion rule appears to have evaluated false when we would have expected it to evaluate true.

*_FYI there will be additional history on the linked ticket_*

Promotion id 2152 on orgid 9000134 is “S13: Complete Your Colorectal Cancer Screening Fitkit_v31”, and member with external id {{oWsJgifLvHErFad2diTarBcKZmk5fYBB+3t:UOWK5jn9}} should have received the benefit  from event id {{c4ee7066-61c0-4f72-8f33-691b7fdcd93c}}

We need some help trying to identify why this rule would have evaluated false.

_it does seem that there could be a tie-in with a previous change that was made as the issue only seems to have happened after that change. See linked tickets for further details of that change_

* Current route used requestRetry which internally stringifies and parse the response, which was causing the issue, So we were testing with an alternative ""axios"" or explore better options

BE:

* In existing attributes route can we add a support where when we pass a query param like isPossibleValuesRequired -> If its true then only send its data else not (we can discuss more on this). This will eliminate large exhaustive data
* Which orgs in prod. have largest data size wise, just for reference

Initially, we log the exception to New Relic, and then return an error response. The MessageResolverService is used to retrieve the ApiError object, where we invoke messageResolverService.getCode(message) and messageResolverService.getMessage(message), passing ex.getMessage() as a string parameter to both methods. During this process, the service attempts to load the properties file using MessageResolverService.loadProperties(). However, when calling Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(), it returns null, leading to a NullPointerException when attempting to load the properties.While checking more the reason might be the error message file is not created.Does Not Create Directories: The code does not create any directories.

Currently, we are sending out alerts on goodwill points allocation, and there seems to be no way to restrict it. Hence, if we set the template and subject to be empty, it triggers an empty email.

Hence, we have to make an option to restrict these alerts.

At the same time, many server errors (5xx errors) occurred, indicating internal server problems.The failure started with an issue in generating a security token (an OAuth token) that the system needs to check and apply the offers. Without this token, the system could not verify if the offer should be applied. Additionally, an AWS server issue was identified where the database server had a problem and was automatically replaced. High CPU usage (99.5%) caused the database to restart, leading to further delays and failures.As a result, since the system could not verify the offer properly, the cashback offer was not applied. We can clearly see that the resource consumption was high and the CPU utilization reached around 99%, which resulted in response times of approximately 30 seconds and ultimately a timeout. Alerts were also generated for the same issue. CC @Suresh Moturi @Ayush Kumar Regards,Harshitha A"", ""mentions"": []}]",

This default value replaces the config values, allowing the email to be sent.Additionally, we cannot modify the parent table membercare.requestsettings, as it is used across the cluster and could impact other organizations.Hence this seems to be not a viable option at all to restrict the goodwill points allocation alert emails.I have raised an enhancement for this \u2192  membercare DB Config Values : GoodwillService Email Triggering PartChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl.java DefaultValue Replacement at Cache \""SELECT IFNULL(rsv.value, rs.defaultvalue) AS value\""2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.578322303Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,577 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.d.m.ChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl - #getConfigValue(150689, 'GWPOINTSCONFIRMEMAILTEMPLATE'): '' in 793.48\u00b5s2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.575775636Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,575 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.d.m.ChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl - #getConfigValue(150689, 'GWPOINTSCONFIRMEMAILTEMPLATESUBJECT'): 'You have received points' in 1.20ms2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.582507023Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,582 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.s.d.GoodwillService - Email Subject is You have received points, Body is"", ""mentions"": []}]",

CP-1297,Promotion API - issualDate timezone is off by 1,"* Environment: UAT
* Organization: UAT Parent

This seems to be the same as [https://capillarytech.atlassian.net/browse/CAP-132745|https://capillarytech.atlassian.net/browse/CAP-132745|smart-link] , which I thought was resolved, but it is now re-occurring since daylight savings time started this Sunday.

The promotion {{issualDate}} shows the datetime in CST, but the offset is in CDT, so parsing the date gives the incorrect time.

For example, I enrolled a user in promotion {{857}} at 11:59 CDT (GMT-5), but the promotion issual date is {{2025-03-13T12:59:32.000-05:00}}, 1 hour off.

Here’s the promotion data API call (request id {{bd1c0aa519e87f26686138bef461937f}}):

*Test Criteria (Not relevant for sustenance team)*

Test that the fraud tagging processing based on member activities can be configured.
# *Identify and set fraudulent member activities rules and thresholds:*
## Refer to fraud suspected and fraud confirmed score and benchmark tables below.
## Test that OOTB fraud rules and thresholds can be configured for monitoring member activities during their visits to MyStays and Accordia properties.
### Transaction Amount Limit - The system will trigger transactions having an amount more than the predefined threshold.
### Transactions on 1 account per day - The maximum number of transactions in a day should be less than a predefined critical threshold.
### Transaction per Week - The maximum number of transactions in a week should be less than a predefined critical threshold.
### Transactions in two zones 6 hours - Transactions happening in 2 different zones on the same day or every 6 hours
#### Customers having transactions more than 1 in a day in different zones are prone to be tagged as fraud. There would be very few customers with purchases in 2 different regions on the same day.
### Redemption on 1 account per day - The number of times the customer has redeemed points should be more than the predefined value to mark fraud.
### Total Points Redeemed  - If the total points redeemed by the customer is more than a critical value, he is more prone to fraud.
## Test that each fraud rule can be configured with a weight of 0-1.
### The defined weight  is given when the count or amount being inspected is +greater than+ the threshold defined.
## Test that fraud score and benchmark can be configured.
### Total fraud score is the sum of the member’s fraud weight after each member's activity is evaluated.
### Test that the 'Critical Fraud Score' can defined. The 'Critical Fraud Score' is the fraud benchmark.
# *Monitor member activities:*
## Refer to fraud suspected and fraud confirmed score and benchmark tables below.
## Test that the system can +inspect+ incoming member activities and tag member activities.
## Test that the system can +assign+ a weight to incoming member activities being inspected.
## Test that the system can update the member’s status to ‘Fraud Suspected’ when the member’s total fraud score +reaches or exceed+ the 'Critical Fraud Score'.
## Test that the system can update the member’s status to ‘Fraud Confirmed’ when the member’s ‘total fraud score’ +reaches+ the 'critical fraud score'.

*Fraud Suspected Score and Benchmark:*

# Fraud Suspected Critical Score = 1 
## Member’s status is updated to 'Fraud Suspected' when a member have a total fraud score of => Fraud Suspected Critical Score for the define period 
## Weight for each fraud rule are reset to zero at the end of each define period

Due to high volume of records for Metro, the call was timing out sometimes. For Example, lets assume that there are 1 lakh records for Metro org.  The 1st API call with fetch records from 1- 1000, then the 2nd API call will fetch 1001 - 2000, then the 3rd will fetch from 2001 - 3000 and so on until all records are successfully fetched.Because of high number of records, the API performance is a little degraded, which means it take lot of time to send the response. Sometimes it takes 8 seconds , sometimes 15 seconds. Due to this the calls which responded < 10 seconds were picked up by the cron and the one which timed out due to readTimeOut default value being 10 seconds, all the records after the timeout did also not get picked.12:00 --- Cron Runs --- Fetches 1-1000, 1001 - 2000 and times out during the 2001 - 3000 call.1:00 --- Cron runs again --- Fetches 3001 - 4000 and times out during 4001 - 5000 record2:00 Cron runs ---- Fetches 5001 - 6000 and so onThis process kept on repeating and the number of records got divided at every hour.As a quick fix we decreased the cron time to 10 mins for faster evaluation of pending records.This ticket was to increase the timeout until we either optimise the APi properly or figure out something else.The change from increasing the readTimeout from 10 seconds to 2 minutes was done and has been released alreadycc @Akhilesh Baldi @Raginee Kumari @Bhuvaneshwari Seshachalam"", ""mentions"": []}]",

# Rewards to use {{/v2/customers/lookup/customerDetails?source=INSTORE&identifierName=external_id&identifierValue=xxxx}} instead of {{/v1.1/customer/get?external_id=xx}}

*Scope of v2 API adoption*

# Use V2 API for all brands.
# Use primary identifier only when INSTOR_V2_PROFILE enabled. Else continue with same order mobile else email else external_id (to avoid any  issues for brands passing non prim identifier)
#  Hard code query param ‘source=INSTORE’. 
## If possible, Provision to accept ‘source’ query param in API doing customer lookup.
# Cache (1 day TTL) org config primary identifier.
