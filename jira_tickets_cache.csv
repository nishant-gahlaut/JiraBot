CP-12245,Optum - Promotion rule not evaluating correctly,"We have a case where a promotion rule appears to have evaluated false when we would have expected it to evaluate true.

*_FYI there will be additional history on the linked ticket_*

Promotion id 2152 on orgid 9000134 is “S13: Complete Your Colorectal Cancer Screening Fitkit_v31”, and member with external id {{oWsJgifLvHErFad2diTarBcKZmk5fYBB+3t:UOWK5jn9}} should have received the benefit  from event id {{c4ee7066-61c0-4f72-8f33-691b7fdcd93c}}

We need some help trying to identify why this rule would have evaluated false.

_it does seem that there could be a tie-in with a previous change that was made as the issue only seems to have happened after that change. See linked tickets for further details of that change_

* Debug the issue , result : found the multiple use=false as the core reason for the failing redemptions
* Work with frontend team (Anuroop) on verifying the reasoning 
* Raise hotswaps for the coupon configs where the multiple use was false and any_use was true and brand was expecting multiple redemptions
* Found all the vulnerable coupon configs and created tickets to brand CSMs to confirm on the redemption settings expectation

Initially, we log the exception to New Relic, and then return an error response. The MessageResolverService is used to retrieve the ApiError object, where we invoke messageResolverService.getCode(message) and messageResolverService.getMessage(message), passing ex.getMessage() as a string parameter to both methods. During this process, the service attempts to load the properties file using MessageResolverService.loadProperties(). However, when calling Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(), it returns null, leading to a NullPointerException when attempting to load the properties.While checking more the reason might be the error message file is not created.Does Not Create Directories: The code does not create any directories.

CP-817,Option to restrict Goodwill Points allocation alerts on Email/Mobile,"Hi Team,

Currently, we are sending out alerts on goodwill points allocation, and there seems to be no way to restrict it. Hence, if we set the template and subject to be empty, it triggers an empty email.

Hence, we have to make an option to restrict these alerts.

Currently, in the new Member Care, we are only showing transactions up to 200 entries, whereas the old Member Care displays up to 500 entries.

Due to this, older transactions do not seem to be visible if the user has a higher number of transactions.

At the same time, many server errors (5xx errors) occurred, indicating internal server problems.The failure started with an issue in generating a security token (an OAuth token) that the system needs to check and apply the offers. Without this token, the system could not verify if the offer should be applied. Additionally, an AWS server issue was identified where the database server had a problem and was automatically replaced. High CPU usage (99.5%) caused the database to restart, leading to further delays and failures.As a result, since the system could not verify the offer properly, the cashback offer was not applied. We can clearly see that the resource consumption was high and the CPU utilization reached around 99%, which resulted in response times of approximately 30 seconds and ultimately a timeout. Alerts were also generated for the same issue. CC @Suresh Moturi @Ayush Kumar Regards,Harshitha A"", ""mentions"": []}]"

CP-849,Misconfigured Streaks,"In Optum Prod Parent (and Optum Parent UAT) orgs there are two streaks which are misconfigured. Eat potassium-rich foods_Streak_v8 (605/509), and Eat slowly_Streak_v8 (604, 508) have the target that they’re tracking mixed up. Currently Eat Slowly streak is tracking completion of Eat Potassium-Rich Foods milestone, and Eat Potassium-Rich Foods streak is tracking completion of Eat Slowly milestone. Due to concerns with client reporting, we are trying to do everything we can to not have to configure new streaks to replace these, and are hoping someone can swap the targets they’re targeting on the back end.
This change should be made in both orgs.

This default value replaces the config values, allowing the email to be sent.Additionally, we cannot modify the parent table membercare.requestsettings, as it is used across the cluster and could impact other organizations.Hence this seems to be not a viable option at all to restrict the goodwill points allocation alert emails.I have raised an enhancement for this \u2192  membercare DB Config Values : GoodwillService Email Triggering PartChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl.java DefaultValue Replacement at Cache \""SELECT IFNULL(rsv.value, rs.defaultvalue) AS value\""2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.578322303Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,577 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.d.m.ChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl - #getConfigValue(150689, 'GWPOINTSCONFIRMEMAILTEMPLATE'): '' in 793.48\u00b5s2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.575775636Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,575 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.d.m.ChangeIdentifiersDaoImpl - #getConfigValue(150689, 'GWPOINTSCONFIRMEMAILTEMPLATESUBJECT'): 'You have received points' in 1.20ms2025-03-21 12:16:39 2025-03-21T06:46:39.582507023Z stdout F 2025-03-21 12:16:39,582 42110284e1c79adf687670d7d339efa7 INFO  c.c.a.v.i.s.d.GoodwillService - Email Subject is You have received points, Body is"", ""mentions"": []}]"
